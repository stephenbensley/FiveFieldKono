# Five-Field Kono

Five-Field Kono is a C++ app that uses retrograde analysis to strongly solve the game of [Five-Field Kono](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-field_kono). Unfortunately, the solution is boring (either player can easily force a draw through an endless repetition of moves), so I never did anything with the solution.
